# Functions II
1. Write a program to read an integer number. Print the reverse of this number using
recursion.
2. Write a program that uses lambda function to multiply two numbers.
3. Write a program that passes lambda function as an argument to another function
to compute the cube of a number
4. Write a program to compute lambda(n) for all positive values of n where, lambda(n)
can be recursively defined as
lambda(n) = lambda (n / 2) +1 if n > 1
5. Write a program to print the Fibonacci series using recursion and without using
recursion.
6. Write a function called printStatus that is passed status code ‘S’, ‘M’, ‘D’, or ‘U’ and
returns the string ‘Separated’, ‘Married’, ‘Divorced’ or ‘Unmarried’ respectively. In case
an inappropriate letter is passed, print an appropriate message. Also include a docstring
with your invitation.
7. Write a function that accepts two positive integers n and m where m<=n, and returns
numbers between 1 and n that are divisible by m
8. Write a function to calculate x to the power of y, where y can be either negative or
positive.
9. Write a program to compute F (x, y) where
F (x, y) = F (x-y, y) + 1 if y < = x
10. Write programs demonstrating
    - Required arguments
    - Keyword arguments
    - Default arguments
    - Variable-length arguments
